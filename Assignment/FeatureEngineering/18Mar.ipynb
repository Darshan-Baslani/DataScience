    "The **Filter method** is a feature selection technique used in machine learning. It involves selecting features based on their intrinsic characteristics without considering the model being used. It typically involves calculating statistical measures like correlation, chi-squared, or mutual information between each feature and the target variable. Features are then ranked or scored based on these measures, and a threshold is set to select the top-ranked features. This method is computationally efficient but may not consider feature interactions that could be important for complex models."

    "The **Wrapper method** is another approach for feature selection in machine learning. Unlike the Filter method, the Wrapper method evaluates feature subsets by training and testing the model iteratively. It uses a specific machine learning model (like decision trees or SVMs) to assess the performance of different feature combinations. This approach is more computationally intensive than the Filter method but takes into account feature interactions and the actual model's performance. It helps to find the best subset of features that optimizes the chosen model's performance."

    "Embedded feature selection methods incorporate feature selection within the process of training a machine learning model. Here are a few common techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization): Lasso adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function, encouraging the model to shrink the coefficients of less important features to zero. This effectively performs feature selection while training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees and Random Forests: Decision trees and ensemble methods like Random Forests can provide feature importance scores. Features with low importance can be pruned or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting: Algorithms like Gradient Boosting provide feature importances as well. Similar to decision trees, less important features can be pruned based on their contribution to the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularized Linear Models: Models like Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) can also lead to feature selection by shrinking less important features' coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net: This combines both L1 and L2 regularization, allowing for a balance between feature selection and regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost and LightGBM: Advanced gradient boosting techniques often provide feature importance scores that can be used for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks with Dropout: Dropout layers in neural networks can be seen as a form of feature selection. During training, certain neurons (features) are \"dropped out,\" effectively ignoring them temporarily."
