One of the features in your dataset is \"Product Category,\" which includes categories like \"Electronics,\" \"Clothing,\" and \"Books.\" Since these categories don't have a specific order, you would use nominal encoding to convert them into numerical values for machine learning algorithms.

One-hot encoding can lead to a significant increase in the dimensionality of the dataset, which might not be practical, especially when dealing with a large number of categories.\n",

    "Practical Example:\n",
    "Let's consider a scenario where you're analyzing customer reviews for a product. The dataset includes a \"Keywords\" column indicating the keywords mentioned in the reviews. These keywords can be quite diverse and numerous, including terms like \"Quality,\" \"Price,\" \"Shipping,\" \"Customer Service,\" and more.\n",

    "Instead, using nominal encoding for the \"Keywords\" column assigns a unique numerical value to each keyword while avoiding the exponential increase in dimensions. This approach helps maintain a manageable dataset size and allows the machine learning algorithm to learn patterns from the keywords without creating an excessively complex model."
