    "**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves creating algorithms and systems that can perceive their environment, reason about it, and make decisions to achieve specific goals. For example, a virtual personal assistant like Siri or Google Assistant uses AI to understand and respond to spoken language, helping users with tasks like setting reminders, sending messages, or providing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)**: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can improve their performance over time through experience. An example of machine learning is email filtering. Instead of writing explicit rules for classifying spam emails, a machine learning model can be trained on a dataset of labeled emails to automatically identify and filter out spam from legitimate emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning**: Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks to model and process complex patterns in data. These neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes that simulate the structure of human brain neurons. Deep Learning has proven particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition. For instance, a deep learning model called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be trained to identify objects in images, allowing applications like self-driving cars to recognize pedestrians, signs, and other vehicles on the road."
