# Q1. Write a Python program that defines a function called "add_numbers" that takes two arguments (i.e.,numbers) and
# returns their sum. Within the function, add the two numbers together and return the result using the return
# statement. Call the function with the values 5 and 6, and print out the returned result. This will result in the
# addition of 5 and 6, with the output of the program being the sum of these two numbers.
def add_numbers(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y


print(add_numbers(5, 6))
